## Home Page

You may watch a slide show of the pictures the website has, or watch it in a form of list, and also a gallery.
if you remember a name of a picture you liked, you can search the name of a picture in the search bar, **notice that that there is no search bar in the carousel**

## Register Page

If you have no account in the website, you may register in the register page, there are a few fields that must be filled, and some optional, **just make sure that when you type into the optional fields you must fill them correctly!**, there is also a link for the login page if you mistaken the register page with the login page.

## Login Page

Once you have an account **(if you dont have one, you can click the new account link down below in the page)**, you may log into your account and start using the web as a logged account! if you are registered as a business account - you can edit some of the pictures, delete or even add one for yourself (the adding option is at your profile list at the nav bar). _if you dont have a business account thats fine, just go to the Profile Page_

## Profile Page

At the profile page you can edit your information! name, email, phone number, address, even your password (requires another step to edit - press the "edit password" button and you are good to go).

## Cart Page (BONUS)

As you will see, at the navbar you have a link to the cart page, there you can see the pictures you have added to your cart. Unfortunately, due to technical problems (no server found) you cannot yet purchase them completely. But don't you worry, once we finish establishing the web site you will be able to purchase the pictures and get your own GalleryPic!
You can add the pictures to your cart at the home page using the 'gallery' and the 'list' displays. If you wish to remove some of the items out of the cart, press the 'remove' button.

_notice_ that the icon of the link changes as you add or remove items from the cart.

## About Page

On the web, you can find an explanation about the web, including the forms that the products can be shown (list, gallery, slide show - carousel), **click the buttons there and they will send you to the related form you clicked on!**

## Page 404 - Page Not Found

If you entered a link of the website which doesnot work dont worry, you will be sent to a page that was made just for those cases. there will be a button back to the home page.
